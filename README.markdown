# Fear Goidte

This repository contains the code, images, and words for my personal website.

If published at all, the site should be available at: [isfeargoidte.me.uk](http://isfeargoidte.me.uk/).

Partials for the website come from my [Cloch Fiacail](https://github.com/FearGoidte/cloch-fiacail) project which is a rather ramshackle assemblage of general stylesheet rules. They are currently added as [symlinks](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man7/symlink.7.html) rather than a [submodule](https://github.com/blog/2104-working-with-submodules) to make local testing easier.

## Nuts & bolts

The website is currently generated by [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com).

## Copyright

There are seperate permissions for the code and for the content.

### Code

Unless otherwise indicated, you are free to use and adapt all code with (or without) attribution. Where derivative code has been used I have attempted to attribute it in the source here, this ‘readme’, and in the website’s colophon ([isfeargoidte.me.uk/colophon/](http://isfeargoidte.me.uk/colophon/)).

### Content
